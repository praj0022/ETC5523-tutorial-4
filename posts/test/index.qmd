**Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe won Great Britain's first ever Olympic medal in artistic swimming and said their duet silver medal was worth all the "really hard times" they had gone through because of poor funding.**

The childhood friends, whose mothers also used to compete as a pair in the sport, performed their Rising Phoenix routine to score 294.5085 - for a combined total of 558.5367 in Paris.
China's Liuyi Wang and Qianyi Wang took gold (566.4783) and the Netherlands' Bregje de Brouwer and Noortje de Brouwer won bronze (558.3963).
Shortman and Thorpe, who said their UK Sport funding was only reinstated less than a year ago, had sat fourth after Friday's Big Ben-themed technical routine before delivering a high-energy free routine.
They looked stunned when they saw their names on top of the leaderboard with two teams still to compete, knowing they were guaranteed a medal.
They covered their mouths in disbelief before the hugs, and tears flowed while a sizeable Union Jack-waving contingent in the Paris Aquatics Centre erupted in celebration.
Asked by BBC Sport to describe how they were feeling, they replied - like their performance - in perfect unison: "On top of the world."
Shortman then added: “I can’t even fathom it right now, can’t put it into words, it’s just an incredible dream come true really.”
